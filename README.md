Crowdfunding has recently gained considerable traction, attracting an increasing number of innovators who publicly present their concepts. This surge in participation has precipitated intensified competition among campaigns, prompting founders to pursue competitive advantages to ensure favourable outcomes.
Among the pivotal determinants of a successful crowdfunding endeavour, the attainment of the funding target and the precise targeting of investors are paramount. Consequently, an efficacious strategy entails hosting the campaign on a platform frequented by the target demographic. Furthermore, appropriately categorizing the campaign within the platform is indispensable for enhancing visibility and efficacy. Nonetheless, the process of categorization is not straightforward due to the potential overlap of campaigns across multiple categories, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of category dynamics across diverse platforms. It is noteworthy, however, that success is not solely contingent upon categorization.
Campaigns within the same categories often exhibit common traits. In this context, a campaign can either embody the typical characteristics of its category or stand out as distinctive based on the project description. While a distinctive campaign may not resonate with investors seeking familiarity within a specific category, a conventional campaign risks being perceived as unremarkable or mundane.
Given the voluminous data generated by diverse crowdfunding platforms, data mining methodologies emerge as invaluable tools to assist founders. Notably, advancements in Machine Learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing, hold considerable promise for analysing textual data and providing substantive support to founders.
This project aims to address two main questions: 
1.	Can Natural Language Processing, specifically the analysis of user-generated text from crowdfunding campaigns, be leveraged to predict the appropriate category allocation for a campaign? 
2.	How does the degree of distinctiveness of campaigns, as gauged through Natural Language Processing, influence their success within a category?
